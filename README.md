# Hi There, I'm Ava!
Hello! My name is Ava Dunphy, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Notre Dame. I walked onto the Women's Rowing Team as a coxswain, and I am majoring in Finance and minoring in Real Estate and Computer Data Technologies. Beyond academics, I am deeply interested in aviation ✈️, travel 🏝️ , and real estate 👩‍💼. These interests drive my desire to establish a career that combines innovation and strategy with a global perspective.

## Education 📚✏️🎓
* Highschool : The Maderia School, McLean VA

* College: The University of Notre Dame, IN

## Goals ✅
1. By the end of this semester I hope to be more confident in my coding ability!
2. By the end of this semester I hope to create a working, creative app.

## Projects 
In my [Python Portfolio](https://github.com/AvaDunphy/Dunphy-Python-Portfolio), you will find three projects that I have been working on throughout the semester. As you move from one project to the next, you will see my coding ability begin to improve with my confidence. Initially, I began to experiment with various coding "clean up" components, which then tied into Named Entity Recognition, and finally, a project where I tied the two together in a way. Overall, the projects have exposed me to more technical code that I hope to build on with time!
